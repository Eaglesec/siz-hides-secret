<h2>What is Digi-Cloak?</h2>
<p>
  Digi-Cloak is an online web tool to hide a secret message in the image using
  cryptography and steganography.
</p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<h4>For locking:</h4>
<p>
  You need to provide a message, password and image. Your message is encrypted
  into unreadable ciphertext using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption
  with the help of a password. Then ciphertext is hidden in the image using the
  LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography technique in such a way that the
  image is unaffected.
</p>
<h4>For unlocking:</h4>
<p>
  You need to provide a password and image (in which the message is hidden). The
  hidden ciphertext is extracted from the image using the LSB steganography
  technique. Then ciphertext is decrypted into a readable message using an AES
  decryption with the help of a password.

<h2>What information is retained?</h2>
<p>No information is retained, all operations happen at browser only.</p>
<h2>How secure is my message?</h2>
<p>
  Your message, password and image are never transmitted, all hiding/unhiding
  takes place in your browser.
</p>
<h2>I misplaced my password, is my message recoverable?</h2>
<p>
  No, that is the point. Your message, password and image are never submitted
  beyond your browser. If the password or image is misplaced, the original
  message is gone forever.
</p>
<h2>Is there a limit to the length of message that can be hidden?</h2>
<p>
  Yes, message length should not be greater than 3 times the number of pixels
  (height x width) in the specified image.
