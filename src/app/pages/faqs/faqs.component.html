<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>
  Plain text is encrypted into cypher text using AES with a 256-bit key. This key is derived from a password specified
  by you or generated using our secure password generator in your browser. Encrypted cypher text is hidden in the image
  using LSB
  (Least Significant Bit) technique in such a way that the image is unaffected. The image is also provided by you or a
  sample image can be used.

<h2>I misplaced my password, is my content recoverable?</h2>

  image is misplaced, the original content is gone forever.

<h2>Is there a limit to the amount of content?</h2>
